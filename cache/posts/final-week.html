As the final week started and the evaluations are now open, I will
sum my work to another post that will be the final link to be submitted.
</p>

<p>
The past few weeks were not the most productive by any means.
The new PC arrived and after setting it up I worked on some patches.
There were some problems with the build that cause the tests to fail
in the trunk. I couldn't resolve it after quite some time so I run 
the tests in the VPS my uni gave me for the summer, where everything was
fine.
</p>

<p>
Some patches I've put some time on turned out to be more confusing than
first though and are still lying unresolved (<a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D49347">D49347</a>, <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D49677">D49677</a>).
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile I had a go at some other bugs listed <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37953">here</a>.
</p>

<p>
There is a proposal in the works for a change to the Instruction
<code>*::Create()</code> constructors. I thought it would be nice if they had a
DebugLoc argument. It will be sent as a RFC in the mailing list.
I am not sure if I'll make it in time for the final evaluation tho.
