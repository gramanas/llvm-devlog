This week, I am struggling with yet another <code>InstCombine</code> bug. Just when I think I've found the
solution it turns out there is more to it.
</p>

<p>
It started as a suggestion for a patch by Vedant when he said I could use the new 
replaceAllDebugUsesWith() routine in a common cast transformation case. Specifically
while casting a PHI it might be possible to fold the cast into the PHI.
</p>

<p>
<code>foldOpIntoPhi()</code> handles the actual folding. In the end before it returs
the new Instruction RAUW is called.
