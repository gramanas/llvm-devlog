The last few weeks that I haven't posted any updates have been pretty laborsome.
</p>

<p>
For one, I had finals in the university, and all of the five classes I was being tested on
were on the same week. This was both good and bad. Good for GSoC because it didn't
consume much of the month, but OTOH bad for my performance because I was giving
one exam after the other.
</p>

<p>
So far the results came for 2 classes and I passed them both, so that's good!
</p>

<p>
On the LLVM side of things, I was struggling with an InstCombine <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48331">bug</a> in 
debug intrinsics loss. It took way more time than anticipated to figure out
what was going on, and how we should fix it. All this time wasn't wasted though,
since I gained valuable experiences! 
</p>

<p>
Let's talk about those now.
</p>

<div id="outline-container-orgc26b797" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgc26b797">Finding bugs</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgc26b797">
<p>
Greg has created a meta <a href="https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37953">bug</a> to group debugify failures across all passes
and have a centralized reference point.
</p>

<p>
I've already made a <a href="https://gramanas.github.io/posts/finding-debuginfo-loss/">post</a> describing a way to find such bugs. Although
Greg's process seems to be a bit different, since it starts from the 
source instead of relying on already crated IR.
</p>
</div>

<div id="outline-container-org1d6f917" class="outline-3">
<h3 id="org1d6f917">Zeroing to the problem</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-org1d6f917">
<p>
First, one has to understand at least what the description of the culprit pass
is, and how it's used to optimize code.
</p>

<p>
Then in the relatively more simple case of missing Debug Location, it's a matter
of running opt with the culprit pass through a debugger, stopping whenever the 
instruction with the missing DL is created and reading through the backtrace 
to find when and where in the code the DL is dropped. Usually the fix is a 
pretty simple one like on <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/rL335904">r335904</a> and <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48769">D48769</a>.
</p>

<p>
In the case of a missing variable though it's more complex. In the aforementioned
InstCombine <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48331">bug</a> for example the fix is not clear at all, since the proper API is not
in place yet. Vedant is tackling this by first <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/rL335144">creating</a> a utility and currently <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48676">enhancing</a> it.

<h2 id="org90daa28">Testing that it works</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org90daa28">
<p>
Another important thing after fixing those bugs, is adding regression tests
to make sure they won't appear again. To that end the <code>-debugify</code> pass 
is especially helpful. (NOTE: <code>-debugify</code> is the pass that applies 
Debug Info to every instruction on a module, <code>-check-debugify</code> is the one
that actually does the checks for DI preservation, after a pass has run)
</p>

<p>
Most of the above patches contain this new kinds of test. Basically
we try to incorporate a RUN line like <code>opt -debugify -culprit-pass</code>,
to the existing tests and add checks for the preservation of DI.
</p>

<p>
An important part of the <code>-debugify</code> pass is that it should be stable enough
to enable it's usage on regression tests.

<h3 id="orgdb22c6e">Finding the test files to modify</h3>
<div class="outline-text-3" id="text-orgdb22c6e">
<p>
Another cool trick Vedant taught me is the usage of assertions to check
whether a sample input IR is passing through the code we juts modified.
</p>

<p>
For example in <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/rL335904">r335904</a> and <a href="https://reviews.llvm.org/D48769">D48769</a>, after I found where in the code the DL
was dropped, using lldb and the sample code from Greg's report, I had to find 
an existing test that went through the same code path as Greg's sample code.
</p>

<p>
In the case of the LoopVectorize pass, there are <b><b>a lot</b></b> of tests to look through.
The following assertion trick makes the process as simple as it could ever get.
</p>

<p>
First I add a failing assertion next to the code I modified:
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">NewAI</span><span class="o">-&gt;</span><span class="n">setDebugLoc</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">AI</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">getDebugLoc</span><span class="p">());</span>
<span class="n">assert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">false</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="s">"gotcha"</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then I modify the bash loop from <a href="https://gramanas.github.io/posts/finding-debuginfo-loss/">here</a> to just run the pass over all the tests.
</p>

<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">for</span> i in <span class="k">$(</span>ls ~/code/llvm/test/Culprit/Pass/*.ll -1<span class="k">)</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="k">do</span> 
    <span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="nv">$i</span><span class="s2">":\n-------"</span><span class="p">;</span> 
    opt -cuplrit-pass -disable-output <span class="nv">$i</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nb">echo</span> -e <span class="s2">"-------\n"</span><span class="p">;</span> 
<span class="k">done</span> &gt; results <span class="m">2</span>&gt;<span class="p">&amp;</span><span class="m">1</span>
</pre></div>

<p>
Then reading through the resulting file, you can clearly see in what test file
there was an assertion, and that means there is a test there that can be used
to check the DI preservation.
</p>

<p>
The assertion backtrace also shows in what IR function the assertion was
triggered so it's easy to find what function to add the DI preservation tests at,
even if the file has many different tests.
