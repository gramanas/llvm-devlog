As the final week started and the evaluations are now open, I will
sum my work to another post that will be the final link to be submitted.

The past few weeks were not the most productive by any means.
The new PC arrived and after setting it up I worked on some patches.
There were some problems with the build that cause the tests to fail
in the trunk. I couldn't resolve it after quite some time so I run 
the tests in the VPS my uni gave me for the summer, where everything was
fine.

Some patches I've put some time on turned out to be more confusing than
first though and are still lying unresolved ([[https://reviews.llvm.org/D49347][D49347]], [[https://reviews.llvm.org/D49677][D49677]]).

Meanwhile I had a go at some other bugs listed [[https://bugs.llvm.org/show_bug.cgi?id=37953][here]].

There is a proposal in the works for a change to the Instruction
~*::Create()~ constructors. I thought it would be nice if they had a
DebugLoc argument. It will be sent as a RFC in the mailing list.
I am not sure if I'll make it in time for the final evaluation tho.
